                <p>Some of you may have seen refrences to this project under the pretense of "Super Hard Botw Mod" or anything related to such title. To put it simply, Relics of the Past takes BOTW and makes it much more difficult.
                    What's so unique about the project however, is how this difficulty is achieved; Rather than buffing the enemies or just making weapons scarcer, Relics of the Past adds the difficulty through new map changes. To be more specific,
                    it does so in a similar fashion to how the DLC adds newly placed objects and enemies. Relics does the same but on a full world scale. This in itself creates a brand new experience while staying true to the fundamentals of the original vanilla game.

                    New Game Plus: In Relics of the Past, one of the most dynamic aspects of the mod is the scaling rework. The scaling in Relics is designed to maintain difficulty even in the later part of the gameas well as make
                    the rewards and drops far better. Late game is typically way more challenging and dynamic than the earlier part of the game. New Game Plus takes these late game attributes and starts you of with them at the beginning of the game.
                    In this mode you will have all the hardest enemies complimented by the best drops and weapons. It makes for a crazy fun and challenging experience.
